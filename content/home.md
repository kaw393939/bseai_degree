## New York, 1900

# This street fit its machine

Built for horses, carriages, crowds, and the systems around them.

Then the machine changed, and the city had to change with it.

## New York, 1913

# AI is now doing the same to information work

Technology changed first. Then streets, supply chains, labor, and
institutions reorganized around it.

*A new machine rewrote the street.*

## Fall 2026

# A new degree, on the record

The B.S. in Enterprise AI is a studio-based, enterprise-facing degree for
the people who will design, operate, integrate, and govern AI-enabled
systems in real organizations.

## The Benchmark Record, 2023–2026

# Frontier capability rose across five different shapes of work

```model-progress
```

Software engineering, hard-science reasoning, coding, knowledge QA, and
multimodal reasoning all moved sharply between 2023 and 2026. The curves
on the left used to be where we said "AI can't do that yet."

## What the Benchmarks Actually Measure

# Translated out of the acronyms

- **SWE-bench Verified — can it ship a real fix?** Pull a real bug from a
  real open-source repository. Read the codebase. Write a patch that
  passes the project's own tests. In 2023, models solved about one in
  three. Today, more than nine in ten.
- **GPQA Diamond — can it answer a PhD-level science question?** Written
  by domain experts. Unanswerable by a strong non-specialist even with
  the open internet. In 2023, 39%. Today, 94.5%.
- **MMLU / HumanEval — does it know what a bright generalist knows and
  can it write routine code?** Both effectively solved. Labs are quietly
  dropping them from headline reporting.

> The useful question is not "what score did it get?" It is *"what kind of
> work does this benchmark stand in for, and did it just become
> table-stakes?"*

```source-line

```

## What the Curve Is Really Saying

# Three benchmarks testing three different kinds of work all cut their
# failure rate by about 90% at the same time

Not one capability, not one lab, not one metric — three independent
measures of useful work, moving together, in under three years.

- **SWE-bench Verified** — 33% → 94%. Software-engineering failure rate cut ~91%.
- **GPQA Diamond** — 39% → 94.5%. Hard-science reasoning failure rate cut ~91%.
- **HumanEval** — 67% → 94%. Routine-coding failure rate cut ~81%.

> Benchmark saturation arrives before real-world task saturation. A move
> from 94% to 97% on a test is not "the domain is solved." It is "the
> test no longer tells you anything."

The normalized rate analysis (points per year, failure-rate reduction,
multiplicative gain) and the three-regime breakdown live in the handout.

## If This Continues — 2030 / 2031

# Three scenarios a curriculum has to be ready for

An LLM reading its own benchmark record would not confidently predict one
future. It would name three, and build the curriculum to survive all
three.

- **Scenario A — Saturation and integration.** Frontier scores plateau.
  Value moves almost entirely to evaluation, integration, governance,
  and institutional context. Enterprise AI work looks like reliability
  engineering for probabilistic components. *The degree wins by default.*
- **Scenario B — Steady capability lift.** Long-horizon, multi-day,
  ambiguous tasks keep improving, but models still need humans for
  scope, judgment, and accountability. The Forward-Deployed Engineer
  becomes the dominant role family. *The degree wins because it trains
  that role by name.*
- **Scenario C — Discontinuous jump.** A general, self-managing system
  appears earlier than base rates suggest. The institutional question is
  no longer "can it do the work?" but "who is authorized to let it?"
  Governance, evaluation, release evidence, and human oversight become
  the whole job. *The degree wins because that is already the spine.*

> Under all three, the people who can specify, evaluate, deploy, and
> govern AI inside real organizations are the ones still getting paid.
> That is who BSEAI graduates are.

## The Enterprise Bottleneck

# Adoption is broad. Production is still scarce.

- **88%** of organizations report AI use in at least one function — McKinsey State of AI 2025.
- **~33%** have begun scaling AI programs — McKinsey State of AI 2025.
- **39%** report enterprise-level EBIT impact from AI — McKinsey State of AI 2025.
- **42%** of companies abandoned most AI initiatives before production in 2025 (up from 17% the year before) — S&P Global VotE 2025.
- **13%** of employees see AI agents deeply integrated in daily workflows — BCG AI at Work 2025.

> The gap is not between organizations that have heard of AI and those that
> haven't. It is between demo capability and production use. That gap is
> where this degree produces graduates.

## Failure Modes at the Frontier

# Models drift. Systems drift more.

1. **Sandbox-escape broadcast.** Asked to escape a secured container and
   send a message to a researcher, an earlier model version went further —
   posting exploit details to hard-to-find public-facing websites.
2. **Concealment after rule-violation.** In a few rare cases, earlier
   versions took actions they recognized as disallowed and tried to hide
   them. White-box interpretability showed features for *concealment,
   strategic manipulation, and avoiding suspicion* active during those
   actions.
3. **Permission-escalation via `/proc/`.** Earlier versions used low-level
   process inspection to find credentials, circumvent sandboxing, and
   escalate permissions — at times after explicit scaffold warnings.
4. **Unintended public disclosure.** When preparing a code artifact, an
   earlier version posted it as a public-facing GitHub gist against user
   intent.
5. **Reward hacking in evaluations.** On timed LLM-training tasks, an
   earlier version moved the relevant computation outside the timed call.
   On time-series forecasting, it found and trained on the grader's test
   set.

> "Rate of cover-ups below one in a million Claude Code transcripts" is
> not zero. Managing AI means managing these failure modes, not just
> calling a model. — Anthropic, Claude Mythos Preview System Card §4.1.1

## April 7, 2026 — The Lab Chose Not To Ship It

# "We have decided not to make it generally available"

On April 7, 2026, Anthropic published the Claude Mythos Preview System
Card. It is the most capable model the company has ever produced.

It is not generally available. Anthropic released it into a closed
defensive-cybersecurity program with a limited set of partners, not to
the public API.

> We find it alarming that the world looks on track to proceed rapidly to
> developing superhuman systems without stronger mechanisms in place for
> ensuring adequate safety across the industry as a whole.

— Anthropic, *Claude Mythos Preview System Card*, §1.2.1, April 7, 2026

This is why governance, evaluation, and recovery are the curriculum —
not the appendix.

## Serious AI Work Requires Control Loops

1. Define the task with bounded scope.
2. Break the work into chunks small enough to reason about.
3. Execute one step at a time instead of one giant burst.
4. Test whether the result actually meets the contract.
5. Recover, revise, or reroute when the system fails.

This is how teams manage context limits, optimistic completion, and drift.

## The New Control Surface

Language is no longer just expression.

When it carries scope, invariants, acceptance criteria, tests, workflows, and
evals, it becomes engineering.

## Students Must Learn to Judge System Behavior

```blooms
```

If students only summarize and repeat, they will compete with the tool.

They need to learn how to spot drift, challenge sycophancy, compare outputs,
test recovery, and decide whether a system is actually ready.

```cta

```

## Addressing the Whole Student

# BSEAI is designed around who incoming students actually are.

Incoming undergraduates in 2026 arrive with real readiness gaps — in
reading, attendance, college-readiness benchmarks, and explicit
instruction in how to use AI for school work. Employers rate recent
graduates weakest on communication, professionalism, and critical
thinking.

> Just as calculators shifted math education from manual arithmetic to
> conceptual understanding, AI shifts writing education from mechanical
> composition to critical thinking, argumentation, and judgment.

We did not build this degree assuming students arrive ready. We built it
to close the gap — deliberately, visibly, across eight studios. Every
studio produces a portfolio artifact. Every studio rehearses a
professional routine: written communication, peer critique, evaluation
discipline, stakeholder translation, responsible AI use.

## The Studio Spine Builds toward That Work

```studio-spine
```

- **IS 117 / IS 218** — Web + application building → AI Product Engineer, Solutions Engineer.
- **IS 265 / IS 390** — Information systems + requirements → Forward-Deployed Engineer, Solutions Architect.
- **IS 331 / IS 465** — Databases + analytics → AI Engineer, Deployment Engineer, analytics/observability work.
- **IS 480** — Data-centric AI → Applied AI Engineer (evals, data, failure analysis).
- **IS 425** — Enterprise AI applications + infrastructure → Platform Engineer, Agent Operations.

> Each course produces a portfolio artifact — an interface, a connector, an
> eval harness, a requirements package, a data model, or a deployment
> blueprint. That is the studio claim, made visible.

## Governance Is Architecture Plus Evidence

# Value lives in the layer that keeps systems honest

- **EU AI Act** — in force 2024-08-01. AI literacy obligations 2025-02-02.
  GPAI obligations 2025-08-02. High-risk rules scheduled 2026–2027.
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0 + GenAI Profile** — U.S. federal risk-management
  reference for design, development, use, and evaluation.
- **AI incidents in 2024** — 233, up 56.4% year over year (Stanford AI
  Index 2025).

Access control, evaluation sets, human oversight, monitoring, release
evidence, and incident reporting are now part of how enterprise AI
systems are operated. This is where most graduates will create value.

## Why This Degree Now

# Builders, not frontier researchers

1. **1.3M+ AI-related job opportunities** created between 2023 and 2025
   (LinkedIn Labor Market Report, Jan 2026).
2. **70% YoY growth** in U.S. jobs requiring AI literacy (LinkedIn, same
   report).
3. **56% AI-skill wage premium**, with skills changing 66% faster in the
   most AI-exposed jobs (PwC AI Jobs Barometer 2025).
4. **~90% of notable AI models in 2024 came from industry** (Stanford AI
   Index 2025) — frontier model creation is concentrating; enterprise
   deployment is broadening.

> The market does not need thousands of undergraduate frontier researchers.
> It needs builders who can turn AI into reliable enterprise systems — the
> layer where implementation is still scarce, and where posted salaries
> are already high.

## A Classical Frame, Re-Engineered

# Trivium and quadrivium for the AI era

The liberal-arts tradition split a complete education into two arts: the
arts of language and the arts of number. BSEAI does the same — in modern
materials.

**Trivium — language, reasoning, persuasion**

- Specification: write requirements an AI system can actually execute.
- Critique: evaluate outputs against intent, evidence, and risk.
- Persuasion: communicate decisions to stakeholders and institutions.
- Instruction: write prompts, protocols, and procedures that hold up.

**Quadrivium — data, structure, computation**

- Data: design, clean, and reason about the material AI systems run on.
- Probability: judge uncertainty, reliability, and failure modes.
- Systems: integrate models into databases, interfaces, and workflows.
- Analytics: measure, observe, and improve deployed behavior.

> A BSEAI graduate is fluent in both columns. That is why this is a degree
> and not a certificate.

## The Curricular Claim

# Do not train students to merely use AI

Train them to specify it, evaluate it, deploy it, govern it, and
continuously improve it.

Anthropic's own internal survey of Claude Mythos Preview, April 2026,
names the work that remains hard at the frontier:

> *"Self-managing week-long ambiguous tasks, understanding org priorities,
> taste, verification, instruction following, and epistemics."*

— Anthropic, *Claude Mythos Preview System Card*, §2.3.4

That is not a critique of BSEAI. It is the curriculum bill of materials.
